# Fractal
We have a programming assignment proposed by [Dr Rami Younes](https://met.guc.edu.eg/People/Profile.aspx?facId=3253) to write some code ( preferably in `python` ) to genterate a fractal.


### Submission Guidelines
- Write your code and start a pull request.
- Create a directory with your name
- Upload your code file (saved with the name of the fractal, e.g. `fractal-name.py`), a screenshot of the result, and requirements.txt in your directory.
- The requirements.txt should contain all the downloaded libraries you have used seperated by new lines
  
  For example 
   ```bash
   > cat requirements.txt
  pandas
  matplotlib
  numpy
  ```


#### Your project sturcture should look like this 
 
 ```

    └── requirements.txt
